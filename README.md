# Simulator

A library of simulators as well as a framework for creating new types of signal simulators.

A simulator is a Block that is comprised of one Generator and one or more 
Triggers. In general, simulators can be "assembled" by using Python's multiple 
inheritance to make use of existing Generators and Triggers. In some cases, 
you may want to define your own Generator or Trigger, this is also documented 
below.

## Generators

Generators are responsible for one and only one thing: generating signals. 
They are classes that can utilize standard block methods (i.e. `start`, 
`configure`, etc) but the only requirement is that they define a 
`generate_signals` method. This method must accept one optional parameter, `n`.
The implementation of `generate_signals` should return a list of `Signal` 
objects with length of list equal to `n`. 

Here is possibly the simplest implementation of a Generator - it will simply 
return empty signals:

```python
class IdentityGenerator():

    def generate_signals(self, n=1):
        return [Signal() for i in range(n)]
```

There is no guarantee that generators will get called from the same thread, so 
it is generally good practice to use `Lock` objects to make the generator 
thread safe. 

Generators likely will need to internally keep track of any additional 
variables used to generate the next signals (i.e. current value that 
increments, UPC codes to simulate, etc). 

### Existing Generators

#### CounterGenerator

Creates signals with one numeric attribute that will increment each time.

##### Properties

-   **attr_name**: The name of the attribute on the Signal
-   **attr_value**:
 -    **start**: Number that the simulator starts at
 -    **stop**: Number that the simulator stops at 
 -    **step**: Number that the simulator increments between each simulation
   -    Note: `start, stop, step = 0, 6, 3` will simulate `[0, 3, 6, 0, 3, ...]`


#### IdentityGenerator

Creates empty signals. This is most likely useful for driving some other type 
of Block that doesn't necessarily care about the signal contents, but rather 
that a signal has been notified.


## Triggers

A Trigger's job is to determine when signals should be generated and notified. 
There is no strictly defined interface for a Trigger's implementation, but it 
will almost certainly need to call `self.generate_signals()` at some point to 
be effective. Just like a Generator, the Trigger can define functionality 
inside standard block methods (just make sure to call `super()` in the 
implementation!). The Trigger is also responsible for notifying the signals, 
so it will likely make some `self.notify_signals` calls as well. 

Here is an example of a Trigger that will generate signals every second. 
> Note: don't use this Trigger, it won't respond to block stop events, it's 
just an example:

```python
class OneSecondTrigger():

    def start(self):
        super().start()
        while True:
            self.notify_signals(self.generate_signals())
            sleep(1)
```

### Existing Triggers

#### IntervalTrigger

Notifies signals every interval.

##### Properties

-   **notify_on_start**: Whether or not to immediately notify simulated signals
-   **interval**: How often should the block notify signals
   
#### SafeTrigger

Notify every interval - regardless of how many signals were created

***Does not support MultipleSignals***

##### Properties

-   **interval**: How often should the block notify signals
-   **max_count**: Maximum signals to notify â€” the block will never notify 
    more signals than this count every interval. However, if the number is too 
    high for it to create, it may return less than this number. The only 
    guarantee made by this block is that a notification will happen every 
    interval


#### FastTrigger

Notifies a number of signals as fast as it can. No intervals, no scheduling, just 
plain `while` loops.

***Does not support MultipleSignals***

##### Properties

-   **max_count**: How many signals you want? Won't notify until we make 'em all
   

## Blocks

Ok, we've got some Generators and some Triggers, now it's time to make a 
block! We're going to use [Python's multiple inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/classes.html#multiple-inheritance) 
support to make this happen; your block just needs to inherit from a Generator 
and one or more Triggers. It will also need to inherit from Block, this must 
be the last import too.

You'll also need to do your "block-y" things here. That means discoverability, 
version properties, etc. In general though, you won't need to implement any 
functionality in the blocks, they will just act as the glue between Generators 
and Triggers.

Here is a Simulator block that makes use of our [Counter Generator](#countergenerator) 
and our [Interval Trigger](#intervaltrigger). So it will count up an attribute 
in signals, and notify them every configured interval.


```python
@Discoverable(DiscoverableType.block)
class CounterIntervalSimulator(CounterGenerator, IntervalTrigger, Block):
    version = VersionProperty('1.0.0')
```

That's it, that's your block! Not a whole lot there, right? That's the idea. 
By having a library of Generators and Triggers, we allow you to create tons of 
combinations of Simulators!


## Multiple Signals

Sometimes it's useful to simulate multiple signals at a time. The simulator 
repository also defines a Simulator Mix-in called `MultipleSignals`. This 
mix-in will define a configuration property called `num_signals` that will 
allow the block configurer to define how many signals get notified each time. 


The mix-in works by intercepting the Trigger's call to the Generator's 
`generate_signals` method and then calls the method with the correct parameter. 
For this reason, it's sometimes important that a Trigger call 
`self.generate_signals()` rather than `self.generate_signals(1)`. If the 
Trigger defines how many signals to generate, the MultipleSignals mix-in will 
ignore the parameter configured at the block.

To enable multiple signal support in your simulator, just inherit from the 
`MultipleSignals` mix-in **first** in your inheritance list:

```python
class CounterIntervalSimulator(MultipleSignals, CounterGenerator, IntervalTrigger, Block):
```
